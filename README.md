Task:
 - Create two square matrices of size n√ón; write a program to
to find the difference of two matrices.
 - Create a mechanism that can be used to measure the time program execution time, or other parameters that the student considers relevant.
 - Solve the problem chosen for the option without using parallelization. Measure the time to solve the problem, or other parameters that the student considers relevant.
 - Solve the problem selected by the option using parallelization. Measure the time to solve the problem or other parameters that the student considers relevant.  Justify the choice of parallelization algorithm.
 - Repeat step 4 using a different number of execution processes. Be sure to check the task on a fixed number of threads: 2 times less than the number of physical cores, on the number equal tophysical cores, on the number equal to logical cores, on the number greater than 2, 4, 8, 16 times the number of logical cores.
 - Repeat step 5 using different data dimensions, depending on the chosen task.
